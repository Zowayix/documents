Not open for Sunday lunch and therefore ignored:
	Sumo Salad

Spicy Ginger Cuisine
	- Chinese sorta stuff (apparently Sichuan cuisine)
	- About $18-22 at the very least for a main course, ignore the house specials
	- Seems pretty fancy, not sure if reservations are mandatory or just a thing
	- Apparently "unlimited rice" and "We also provide unlimited Yum-Cha at lunch time!"
	- Corner Hutton St & Childers St - can't miss it as you go to the Capital Smash room
	
Shanghai Dumpling Cafe
	- Also Chinese
	- $11-13.50
	- Apparently busy/crowded (I dunno about that)
	- The other corner of Hutton St & Childers St, opposite Spicy Ginger Cuisine

Yummy Chinese BBQ
	- Yet another Chinese
	- Along Rimmer St (near the bus stop to go home)
	- Where the heck is the menu?
	- The website is down and has been for a while
	- Apparently it's an all you can eat for $35 thing?
	- Might not even be open for lunch?
