Emerald
	- Held items worth giving a crap about (* - One use):
		- Light Ball
		- Thick Club
		- Choice Band
		- Leftovers
		- Quick Claw
		- Lum Berry*
	- Only if you have nothing else to hold:
		- Shell Bell
		- Focus Band
		- Scope Lens
		- BrightPowder (and by extension Lax Incense)
		- King's Rock (NB: Only affects "vanilla" moves)
	- Can use clone glitch to get 999999 copies of normally one-only items (but can only use one each per "session")
	- Tower
		- Wait until apprentice is ready (give her stupid ideas)
		- Anabel's pokeymans (and their ideal counters)
		- Raikou w/ Thunderbolt, CM, Reflect, LumRest
			- Flygon should nuke this with ease (might even be faster due to EVs/IVs)
		- Latios w/ BrightPowder, Psychic, Dragon Claw, CM, Recover
			- Dark type of course
			- Probably Tyranitar or perhaps Houndoom
		- Snorlax w/ Curse, Return, ChestyRest, Shadow Ball
			- Tyranitar fo sho (with some Fighting attacks)
		- Mine
			- Flygon
				- Earthquake
				- Dragon to the Claw
				- Rock to the Slide
				- Fire to the Blast
			- Tyranitar
				- Rock Slide
				- Crunch
				- Dragon Dance (why not)
				- Brick Break
			- Something (special based for balance purposes) to cover their weaknesses
				- Uncovered weaknesses of Flygon and TTar: Ice, Dragon, Fighting, Bug, Steel (lol), Water, Grass
				- Stuff from OU/BL (with score, num types covered (counting immunities as 2)- num types uncovered):
				- Starmie covers Ice, Fighting, Water, Steel (but opens Grass, Bug weakness) 4 - 2 = 2
				- Gengar covers Fighting, Bug, Grass (and I already have one ready for use) 4 - 0 = 4
				- Zapdos covers Fighting, Bug, Steel, Grass, sort of Water (but opens Ice weakness, albeit this is almost covered by TTar) 5 - 1 = 4
				- Metagross (it can be mixed) covers Fighting, Ice, Dragon, Steel, Grass 5 - 0 = 5
				- Charizard/Moltres covers Ice, Fighting, Bug, Steel, Grass (but opens Water weakness) 5 - 1 = 4
	- Pyramid
		- These are all weak to Rock, so feasible to use 1..2 for these and then Blissey for healing
		- Articuno w/ Scope Lens, Blizzard, Water Pulse, Aerial Ace, Reflect
		- Zapdos w/ Lum, Thunder (lol), Drill Peck, Detect, Light Screen
		- Moltres w/ BrightPowder, Fire Blast, Aerial Ace, Hyper Beam (lol), Safeguard
		- Articuno has Water Pulse, which may present a problem with slower Rock types (read: Not Aerodactyl)
		- Aerodactyl has glaring Blizzard and Thunder weakness
	- Common
		- Remember we can use cloning to get around four-moveslot syndrome (but cannot use two of same species in one round)
